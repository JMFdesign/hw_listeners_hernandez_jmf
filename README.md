## Resources

  * I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions

  * I, *Jessica Marie Francis Arnieri Hernandez*, reviewed the list of deductions for this project and the syllabus.

## Comments

  * I really wanted to get this one right as JavaScript is still something that does not come naturally to me, so I chose to take a deduction for a late submission rather than turning something in that I was not proud of.  I hope you agree that it paid off.
